Revising for the Engineering Tripos can seem like a daunting task. With a mammoth amount of content and principles to learn, the last thing you need is your DoS complaining you haven't done any Tripos revision. However, we've set out to make this task a little easier.
</p>
Some of the things that you can do:
<ul>
    <li> Email yourself a Tripos question at a set schedule. 
Send yourself a random tripos question from a topic/ custom topic, as little and often as you'd like.</li>
<li>Browse past paper questions by topic.
You can mark questions you've done, rate and save questions for later, among other features. This website does not contain cribs, but you know where to look if you want them...</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
As of March 2020, we're offering questions from IB, although we'll add questions from other years soon.
