# A Tripos A Day

> A Tripos A Day keeps the doctor away...!

*A Tripos A Day* helps you become a better engineer by randomly setting you Tripos questions at a frequency of your choice. You can subscribe to different lists, such as the general list of all questions, questions recommended on examples papers, or specific topics that you need practice at. You can also compile custom Tripos tests that mix and match questions.

## Development

ATAD uses express and `node.js` and it is kindly hosted by the Student-Run Computing Facility.

## Credits

Credits for the initial idea go to Jeremy, who with me turned this into something!
